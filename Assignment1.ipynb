        "##1. Introduction\n",
        "  The purpose of this report is to review a research paper on a theme of data mining, artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. The topic chosen for this review report is on artificial neural networks and support vector machine methodology, these are methodologies mainly used for predicting certain domains by processing past data in form of training and testing datasets. Analysis is done on Implementing the above methodology on lost circulation, which is a process of loosing drilling fluid while digging into the earth ins search for fossil fuels (Abbas et al. 2019). The paper is critiqued in multiple perception by critical thinking and background research. Understanding how machine learning procedures are applied to real world problems and what is required from the domain to be extracted to implement these models.\n",
        "##2. Content \n",
        "2.1 Problems about the topic\n",
        "One of the most widely recognized issues experienced in the penetrating of oil and gas wells. Lost circulation, which relates to the bothersome loss of entire or a piece of boring liquid into an arrangement. It very well may happen during any phase of boring activities A huge number of dollars are being gone through consistently because of lost circulation or dissemination and the unfavourable impacts it causes (Chen et al. 2017). It frequently triggers multiple drilling problems that are hard to control and as a rule lead to exponential development of non-profitable time and the undesirable const. Also, lost circulation may likewise prompt related issues of penetrating, for example, well control, borehole shakiness, stuck pipe, production failure (Abbas et al. 2019). \n",
        "2.2 Problems in Creating a MODEL\n",
        "The principle center identified with lost flow as of late was the manner by which to create productive lost circulation materials (LCMs) and stopping innovation. Relying upon field understanding and lacking orderly hypothetical direction, the proficiency of the LCMs is small. Be that as it may, there is little center around the forecast of lost course chance, coming up short on a keen expectation model considering geographical and operational parameters. A few elements influence the seriousness of lost flow. Because of the high unpredictability and nonlinear conduct of these parameters, finding a sensible scientific answer for anticipate the lost circulation isn't basic (Abbas et al. 2019). \n",
        "##3. Innovation \n",
        "In this research paper, a new model has been proposed to predict lost circulation, during the period of time preceding the drilling, geographic conditions, materialistic requirements and fluid attributes, thus, collecting all the data of previous records of wells drilled for oil and gas. Describing the novelty of the paper goes by injecting data mining and data analysis into the problem of drilling approaches and to come up with the solution by modelling ANN and SVM. Thus, there is a comparison between two learning models, for the best solution in terms of accuracy and stability on training and testing data.\n",
        "###3.1 Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)\n",
        "With the help of neurons, which are the four components listed as input data, weights, transfer function and output data. These components build a network which have three layers i.e. input layer, hidden layer and output layer. Artificial neural network is used to perform dynamic tasks which are non-linear in system. It produces a single output on the basis of multiple input, and the result is achieved by comparing the output produced with the desired output. Hence, the transfer between the neurons takes place until the output is close to the desired output. ANN is divided in two main types, the first one is forward feed network, second is recurrent network which performs recursive algorithm. At the beginning random weights and bias are assigned, after calculating the error signals and desire to reach the original output, which is done by back propagation of weights through transfer function (Abbas et al. 2019).\n",

        "Support vector machine lays out a high-dimensional hyperplane H plus and H minus on which the parameters are separated optimally in a non-linear fashion. For optimizing parameters, generalization and regularization is needed. In this study, kernel functions are used to reduce model errors and complexity of feature space, for which Gaussian and Polynomial will be applied on the parameters. To create a boundary between two classes that divides the hyperplane are H+ = w.p – b = +1 and H- = w.p - = -1, which is done by classification and regression technique. With the help of Lagrangian it Is possible to optimize the feature space in a dual space for binary classification (Abbas et al. 2019).\n",

        "Features are extracted from case study related to the theme of research. Total 25 variables were included in the dataset, to make the input variable efficient, fscaret package was used to identify important attributes which is done by wrapper model (Szlek 2015). Finally, 18 input parameters were fixed, lithology being at the top rank and hole size being the lowest of all.\n",

        "Neurons which can also termed as input variables or strength of connection between neurons participate in transfer function. Here, forward feed back propagation (FFBP) is used to network the parameters for desired outputs. As we can see, the line rises up to 45 nodes, that means it is getting closer to the desired out till 45 nodes with an accuracy metrics of 0.87. Comparing these neural networks with two techniques, such as, transfer signal (TANSIG) and logistic signal (LOGSIG) which identify error signals and work on it to build an efficient model (Abbas et al. 2019).\n",

Regularization of data is done by taking factors of variance for Gaussian and degree for polynomial (Abbas et al. 2019. The final result pointed out that Gaussian was more efficient than the other with dominating the accuracy metrics by 0.13, noting 0.92 accuracy which is also greater than TANSIG accuracy of ANN.\n",

        "•\tThe research results are extracted from multiple cases of lost circulation, so it is a pre-experimental research design. Hence, there are no assumptions made, constructive knowledge of methodologies used and how the models are fed by acquiring relevant variables are shown.\n",
        "•\tThe criteria measures for the performance are given in forms of figures and direct results. In depth explanation of executing the models is not mentioned, thus the information is in-adequate. Though referring to the cases it proves that the variables are realistic and can validate independent and dependant variables.\n",
        "•\tComparison of performance metrics between two models were presented in a table form with accuracy, specificity and sensitivity. \n",
        "•\tThe explanation given and conclusion drawn are consistent with the research study.\n",
        "##5. Application and X-factor \n",
        "  After considering and digging deep in the research paper, as a reviewer, it was easy to understand the application i.e. lost circulation. As the main objective of reviewing was to know how a problem is resolved by using machine learning technique, this paper is a thorough example of applied mechanism. Focusing on the data of the application domain, further narrowing down to get the best parameters to build an efficient model which tailors exceptional results for improved process of the application. The techniques of ANN and SVM align with application domain, as drilling wells for gas and oil have been tested in new way based on the new models (Abbas et al. 2019). At the end, SVM dominating in the results of accuracy and specificity over ANN to be an accurate model.\n",
        "  The most interesting analysis made in this paper was the level detail to select the required parameters to develop the model. To validate and identify compatibility of input parameters some observations made during circulation were subjective and the measurements were not in a line with objective of the prediction, hence, they were ignored by using feature selection technique. My suggestions for the research work would be trying different data selection methods such as cross validation and grid search, then split the data instances into sub-sets and feed them to the models (Hsu 2016).\n",
        " On similar grounds, the same research work was applied for groundwater level predictions which included time series models to improve accuracy of ANN and SVM (Yoon et al. 2016). The result was evaluated by comparing two models in terms of direct prediction, recursive prediction and weighted error function. Further discussions can be made by comparing multiple models for solutions or maybe create a hybrid model by taking positives of each, and building an efficient model. Also, considering data selection and input parameters are base of machine learning technique.\n",
        "##6. Presentation\n",
        "  The research paper was well presented, as the main methodology was artificial neural networks and support vector machine, they were explained in detail with definitions, diagrams and expressions. The application domain and problem faced by the domain was well elaborated, making the dataset familiar with the theme, which led to the implementation of a new model. Laying down the parameters in drilling operations and factors around it, also, linking those parameters with feature selection was easy to follow.\n",
        "  My suggestion of improvement would be in the structure of the paper, a separate heading from data acquisition would have been better because it is a collecting data from the application domain and the first two sub-heading under Methodology were explanation of machine learning techniques. To maintain a flow of content is essential for a reader to understand. Overall, it is a great research paper to acquire knowledge on ANN and SVM and how it can be applied to real world problems.\n",
